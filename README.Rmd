## Working with databases
```{r}
library(DBI)
library(odbc)

driver="SQL Server"
server="fbmcsads.database.windows.net"
database="WideWorldImporters-Standard"
uid="adatumadmin"
pwd="Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd"


con<-dbConnect(odbc(), 
               driver = driver,
               server = server,
               database = database,
               uid = uid,
               pwd = pwd)
